<strong>1. Build a Strong Foundation in Fusion Technical Concepts</strong><br />
<br />
The first step in preparing for the AD0-E902 exam is understanding the technical concepts involved in building Fusion scenarios. This section makes up 39% of the exam, and you'll need to be proficient in the following areas:<br />
<br />
- Field Transformation: Practice converting data between different field formats. Learn about available functions and how to use them to manipulate data.<br />
- Nested Functions: Be comfortable nesting functions inside each other to complete complex transformations.<br />
- Teams and Access Control: Learn how to control access to connections and other features using teams in Workfront.<br />
- Time Zone Manipulation: Understand how time zone handling works and know when to override the default time zone.<br />
- Flow Control: Get familiar with routes, iterators, and aggregators to manage the flow of data and ensure business logic is implemented correctly.<br />
- Error Handling: Learn how to troubleshoot Fusion scenarios and resolve errors using the Fusion Dev Tool.<br />
<br />
Preparation Tip: Hands-on practice is essential for mastering these technical concepts. Spend time building Fusion scenarios using the Workfront API, exploring the modules, and testing your knowledge with real-world use cases.<br />
<br />
<strong>2. Master Scenario Design and Architecture</strong><br />
<br />
The second section, Scenario Design and Architecture, accounts for 35% of the exam and evaluates your ability to design effective solutions that achieve business outcomes. Key topics to cover include:<br />
<br />
- JSON Parsing: Understand how to parse JSON data and convert it into bundles, following the correct sequence of steps.<br />
- Data Lookups: Learn the most effective methods for performing data lookups to retrieve and manipulate data across systems.<br />
- Trigger Types: Know the difference between instant and scheduled triggers, and how to choose the right one based on business requirements.<br />
- Optimizing Scenarios: Focus on simplifying and optimizing scenarios for maintenance and performance. Be able to identify when to reduce data flow through a scenario to increase efficiency.<br />
- Error Handling and Troubleshooting: Learn how to address common errors like Error 403: Forbidden and Error 429: Too Many Requests, and understand their causes.<br />
<br />
Preparation Tip: Design several Fusion scenarios from scratch to ensure you're familiar with common architectures. Testing different modules, triggers, and flow controls will give you valuable experience in real-world situations.<br />
<br />
<strong>3. Focus on Testing and Error Handling</strong><br />
<br />
The Testing and Error Handling section is smaller in weight but still critical to passing the exam, contributing 16% to the overall score. To excel in this section, you should focus on:<br />
<br />
- Test Plans and Test Cases: Understand the key components of test plans and test cases, and how to structure them for Fusion scenarios.<br />
- Custom Error Handling: Learn how to add custom error handling into Fusion scenarios, especially in the context of unreliable services.<br />
- Incomplete Executions: Be able to track, read, and resolve incomplete executions in Workfront Fusion.<br />
- Handling Invalid Data: Know how to manage missing or invalid data when executing a scenario.<br />
<br />
Preparation Tip: Develop an approach to debugging and error handling. Practicing with common error scenarios and using the Fusion Dev Tool to troubleshoot will strengthen your confidence in this area.<br />
<br />
<strong>4. Get Comfortable with APIs</strong><br />
<br />
The final section, Working with APIs, covers 10% of the exam. This section tests your knowledge of how to interact with APIs, a crucial aspect of Workfront Fusion integration. Topics to cover include:<br />
<br />
- API Requests and Responses: Learn about common HTTP error codes like 429: Too Many Requests and know how to implement solutions to prevent them.<br />
- Using Third-Party APIs: Familiarize yourself with the Workfront API, and learn how to work with third-party APIs, including handling requests to systems that donâ€™t have dedicated apps.<br />
- CRUD Operations: Understand the basics of CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and how to leverage them within Fusion scenarios.<br />
<br />
Preparation Tip: Practice using the API Explorer in Workfront to send and receive API calls. Understanding how to make effective API calls will help you on the exam and in your professional role.<br />
